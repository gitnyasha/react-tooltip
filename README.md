# React Tooltip Example

React is a component-based library, which means that everything in React is a component. Components are reusable and independent pieces of code that have their own logic and state. By building your own tooltip component from scratch, you will gain a deeper understanding of how components work in React and how to create custom interactive components. You will also get to work with CSS to style your tooltip and make it look and behave the way you want.
